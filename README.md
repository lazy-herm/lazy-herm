- 👋 Hi, I’m ... @lazy-herm
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a number of things but related to coding I enjoy data processing, manipulation and presentation. I'm an ex-accountant and wish I had known more about coding back then.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python with a framework that I have yet to pick, likely React. I have a solid base in PHP and Visual Basic so not a complte novice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that involves financial data. I have a personal website that I work on that processes all my financial data and presents me my expenses and net worth (almost). Bot trading is also something I want to jump into.
- 📫 How to reach me ... on tiwtter @lazyherm
